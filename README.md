# Card match game
Simple card matching game made with React (Hooks), Redux and React Router.
## Overview
The goal of the game is to find all matching pairs of cards. There are 4 different difficulty levels to choose from and each of them increases the number of cards you need to match. At the end of each succesful game you will be prompted to enter your name and the score will be saved to the scoreboard (visible from the main menu).
## Technologies used
This project was created using React Hooks API with Redux for state management and React Router. Styling was taken care of by SASS with SCSS syntax.
## Installation (dev environment)
Make sure you have npm installed, then do the following in the shell of your choice:

```
git clone https://github.com/micdra7/card-match-game.git
cd card-match-game
npm install
```

To run the development server type `npm start`.
## Build
Typing `npm run build` while in the root directory of the project will get you a production-ready version of the project
## Plans for the future
As can easily be seen, this projects is not yet finished. All cards in the future will be hidden by default, and the pictures will be shown after clicking on them. The whole app definitely needs much more styling, but the core functionality has already been implemented.
